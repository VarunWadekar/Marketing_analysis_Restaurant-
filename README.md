# Restaurant_Marketing_analysis
The marketing data analysis is the process of creating a story using the data for easy and effective communication. It mostly utilizes visualization methods like plots, charts and tables to convey what the data holds beyond the formal modelling or hypothesis testing task.

In this project, I have performed data scrubbing and data visiualization with different charts. 
The objective of this project is to express all ratings and their relation with current trends, food categories, cost of food etc from the given Restaurant data set
